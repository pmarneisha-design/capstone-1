# Accounting Ledger Application
This is a financial transaction app that I created to track and store financial transactions. This application can be used in the real world as the foundation for a simple banking system, personal finance tracking, small business accounting, and budget planning. 

  The program has different screens and menus that make it easy to:
  * Add new transactions
  * View all deposits or payments
  * See every transaction in one list

The Accounting Ledger Application uses file handing to store, update, and read data from a CSV file. Every time a user adds a deposit or payment, the information is saved automatically to the transactions.CSV file so it isn't lost when the program closes. This builds a permanent record of the users transactions over time.

## Application Features
* Menu Navigation - A simple, interactive menu allows users to easily navigate between adding transactions, viewing the ledger, and exiting the program.
* Add Deposit - Users can record incoming funds with a date, time, description, vendor, and amount.
* Add Payments - Users can record outgoing payments, automatically treated as negative amounts in the ledger.
* CSV File Storage - All transactions are saved to a CSV file so the data persists between sessions.
* View All Transactions - Users can display every transaction recorded in the ledger.
* View Deposits Only - Filter transactions to display only deposits for easier tracking.
* View Payments Only - Filter transactions to display only payments for better expense management.
* Return to Home Page - Users can navigate back to the main menu from the ledger menu or other sections easily.


## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of programming concepts and how they come together to form a working application. 

The areas I learned about include:

 * Classes and Objects - How to create and use custom classes to represent real-world data.
 * Methods - How to organize code into reusable blocks to perform specific actions.
 * File Input and Output - How to save and retrieve transaction data using FileWriter and a BufferedReader.
 * Conditional/Control Structures - How to use loops and switch statements to handle user choices and menu navigation.
 * Error Handling - How to manage errors and exceptions safely with try/catch blocks. 

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges I faced was not knowing al the programming concepts. I often had to refer back to my notes and tutorials to full understand how the code worked. There were moments when the logic didn't click right away and I had to slow down and rebuild my understanding from the basics.


## Personal Growth and Reflection
I am most proud of my perseverance while programming my project. Even when the material felt overwhelming, I kept going until I understood it. I'm also proud of how I used this project as a learning opportunity to gain insight into how real-world programs store, read, and display data. I also appreciate that my instructor didn't give up on me. I was hesitant to speak up at first because I had no prior coding experience, but with guidance and determination, I began to make real progress and gain more confidence in my coding abilities.

## Final Thoughts
This project showed me that programming isn't linear nor about being perfect. It's about progress and growth. Taking the time to appreciate the journey and crafting every small detail with perfection before moving on. Building this project helped me understand what I need to learn next for future projects. I now have a clearer path for improving my programming skills.
